# Blobby's Adventure
An incomplete prototype of a sidescroller I worked on for the TI-83 and TI-84 calculators in 2011.

For more info about uploading the game to your calculator, see [https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/431/43129.html](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/431/43129.html).

The source code is written in [z80 assembly language](https://tutorials.eeems.ca/ASMin28Days/lesson/toc.html).
